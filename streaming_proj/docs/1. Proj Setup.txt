Real-Time Case Study Project Setup:
===================================

Prerequisite:

1. Install Python3
2. Install MYSQL (Mysql.txt)
3. Install Cassandra (Cassandra.txt)
4. Install Apache Kafka (Kafka.txt)
5. Install Superset (Superset.txt)

Run Code:
--------

Activate your virtual environment (venv) and install all the dependencies from requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run realtime_streaming.py, which will listen for messages from Kafka.

Run kafka_producer.py, which will generate messages and send them to the orders-event topic.
Run kafka_consumer.py, which will retrieve messages generated by the producer.

Now, realtime_streaming.py will read those messages in near real-time, storing the raw data in Cassandra and the processed data in MySQL.

Log in to Superset and connect to the MySQL database we are using. Then, create a dashboard using the data from the database for analysis.
